:mod:`sphinx.ext.inheritance_diagram` -- Include inheritance diagrams
=====================================================================

.. module:: sphinx.ext.inheritance_diagram
   :synopsis: Support for displaying inheritance diagrams via graphviz.

.. versionadded:: 0.6

This extension allows you to include inheritance diagrams, rendered via the
:mod:`Graphviz extension <sphinx.ext.graphviz>`.

It adds this directive:

.. directive:: inheritance-diagram

   This directive has one or more arguments, each giving a module or class
   name.  Class names can be unqualified; in that case they are taken to exist
   in the currently described module (see :dir:`module`).

   For each given class, and each class in each given module, the base classes
   are determined.  Then, from all classes and their base classes, a graph is
   generated which is then rendered via the graphviz extension to a directed
   graph.

   This directive supports an option called ``parts`` that, if given, must be an
   integer, advising the directive to remove that many parts of module names
   from the displayed names.  (For example, if all your class names start with
   ``lib.``, you can give ``:parts: 1`` to remove that prefix from the displayed
   node names.)


New config values are:

.. confval:: inheritance_graph_attrs

   A dictionary of graphviz graph attributes for inheritance diagrams.

.. confval:: inheritance_node_attrs

   A dictionary of graphviz node attributes for inheritance diagrams.

.. confval:: inheritance_edge_attrs

   A dictionary of graphviz edge attributes for inheritance diagrams.
